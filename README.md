# Government Spending Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes **government spending transactions** to uncover trends, detect anomalies, and provide insights into budget allocations. Using **machine learning** and **data visualization**, this analysis aims to help policymakers and analysts understand spending patterns.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data preprocessing, machine learning, and analysis
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and transformation
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning model for anomaly detection
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Exploratory data visualization
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboard for financial insights

## Datasets
- **Raw Datasets**:  
  - `dfA.xlsx` - Contains government spending records  
  - `dfB.xlsx` - Additional spending transactions  
- **Cleaned Dataset**:  
  - `merged_df.xlsx` - The final dataset after preprocessing

## Machine Learning Model
- **Algorithm Used**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Objective**: Identify outlier transactions and determine key features impacting anomalies

## Power BI Dashboard
The **interactive dashboard** provides:
- Key financial metrics (total obligations, budgetary resources, and unobligated balance)
- Spending breakdown by agency, program, and budget categories
- Anomaly detection to highlight irregular spending patterns

## Repository Contents
- **`Government Spending Data Analysis.ipynb`** – Python script for data preprocessing and model training
- **`data`** – Folder containing datasets
- **`government_spending_report.md` – Report detailing key findings, recommendations, and machine learning performance analysis.
